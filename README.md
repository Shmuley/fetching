## Building and Running

You can do this one of two ways, either downloading and installing the dotnet 8 SDK, or downloading and installing Docker. I primarily work from a linux machine and use VS Code, so you may notice there is a ```.devcontainer``` folder, which can be used to setup the project in VS Code and build from within a container. However, that requires you also install VS Code _as well_ as Docker, and that seems like a lot to ask, so I'm leaving those instructions out here but recommend you [check it out](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) if that seems cool to you.

### Install Dotnet SDK

All of the step here take place in the root of the repository unless otherwise stated

- Install the SDK
  - You will need to install .NET 8 SDK. Microsoft has a decent guide for installing on any OS, you can find that [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Build the application
  ```bash
  dotnet build Fetching.Service/Fetching.Service.csproj -c Release -o build
  ```
- Run the tests
  ```
  dotnet test
  ```
- Run the application, you will need to pass the application a valid YAML file as so:
  ```bash
  dotnet ./build/Fetching.Service.dll <path-to-your-yaml-file>
  ```

### Using Docker

If you prefer to use docker instead of installing the dotnet SDK, you can follow these instructions. Again, unless othertherwise stated, the following steps should be run in the root of the repo

- Install Docker
  - Honestly, if you don't already have Docker installed I'd recommend following the dotnet SDK based instructions above, but if you wish to proceed, instructions for installing can be followed [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Build the container
  ```bash
  docker build -t fetching .
  ```
- Run the container
  - You will need to mount your yaml file in the docker container for this to work, you can do that using the following command: 
    ```bash
    docker run -v <full-path-to-yaml-file>:/app/input.yaml --rm fetching:latest input.yaml
    ```

## Additional Features

### Latency Threshold
During testing I would often wonder if my availability calculation was actually working, so I added a property for adjusting latency in the ```Models/EndpointConfig.cs``` called ```LatencyThreshold```. This made it possible to change the latency threshold for each individual endpoint by adding the equivalent property to the yaml file, ```latencyThreshold```, like so:
```yaml
- headers:
    user-agent: fetch-synthetic-monitor
  method: GET
  name: fetch.com index page
  url: https://fetch.com/
  # The sweetspot for this endpoint seems to be around 200
  # You get a good mix of UPs and DOWN here, any lower or higher tends to make things one sided
  latencyThreshold: 200
  (...)
```

### Endpoint Tracking
This was honestley a mistake, I misunderstood the instructions at first and was tracking each full URL instead of aggregating by hostname, so I built in UP and DOWN tracking for each ```EndpointPolling``` object. This means if you wanted to extend this app to track the avaialbility of individual endpoints, the data is already being tracked, and can be accessed like so
```csharp
// Program.cs

while (true)
{
    foreach( var hostnamePoll in hostnamePolling)
    {
        await hostnamePoll.PollHostnameAsync(client);

        foreach (var endpointPoll in hostnamePoll.EndpointPollers){
            Console.WriteLine(endpointPoll.GetAvailability());
        }
    };
    Thread.Sleep(pollIntervalSpan);
}
```
In the example above we are adding to the while loop in the main method to print the endpoint availability. This also turned out to be useful with troubleshooting individual endpoints.
